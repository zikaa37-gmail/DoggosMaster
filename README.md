# Doggos

## Introduction

This project is a web application that allows users to view and filter a list of dog breeds and view images of each. The application uses the [Dog CEO API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to fetch the list of dog breeds and images.

The aim of this project is to demonstrate the use of the Angular framework to create a simple web application.

## Criteria

- I would like to be able to view a list of dog breeds and their sub-breeds.
- I would like to be able to search and filter the list of dog breeds and their sub-breeds.
- I would like to be able to view an image gallery of a specific breed of dog.
- I would like to be able to see links to sub-breeds, if any, when viewing a breed.
- I would like to be able to view an image in full-screen.

## Requirements

- No external libraries or frameworks should be used. This includes additional Angular libraries, CSS frameworks, etc.
- The application should be responsive and work on both desktop and mobile devices.
- No mock data should be used. The application should fetch data from the Dog CEO API.

## Additional Information

- No page routing requirements are specified. This will be up to the developer to decide.
- No design requirements are specified. This will be up to the developer to decide but should be clean and user-friendly.
